## 📝 Description

Bag of Holding is a practical inventory manager built with the MERN stack that allows users to:

- View a list of common equipment and magic items.
- Add items from the database into their party's inventory.
- Remove items as they are consumed, traded, or dropped.
- Eventually, fetch randomized item data from a 3rd-party D&D API (coming soon).

The app was built as a capstone project for a full-stack JavaScript course, focusing on CRUD operations, API integration, React hooks, and MongoDB data modeling.
